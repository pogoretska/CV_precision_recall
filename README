CV detector precision and recall table

About
-------------

Takes as input two csv files with data - one with ground truth objects,
second with candidates, identified by detector (each line containing object
class, frame number, position of its bounding box; for candidates also
confidence).

Checks each candidate if it matches some ground truth object by set of rules
(same frame, same object class, overlapping area) and filter out
best-matching pairs.

Counts detector precision and recall values for ranges of confidence from
[0..0.1) to [0.9..1).

Compiling
-------------

Makefile included.

Run
-------------

Input: paths to two .CSV files with gto and cnd data respectively.
Output: prints number of detected matches and precision and recall table.
